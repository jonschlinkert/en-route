## How it works

en-route is a different, but similar concept to routes you might be familiar with, like express routes. The general idea is, you can:

1. Use middleware to modify file objects
1. Define routes, to determine whether or not a middleware function should run on a given file.
1. Define [handlers](#handlers) for running specific middleware at specific points in your application or build.

See the [examples folder](./examples) for a number of different examples of how en-route works.

## Usage

```js
const Router = require('en-route');
const router = new Router();
```

## API
{%= apidocs("lib/router.js") %}
{%= apidocs("lib/route.js") %}
{%= apidocs("lib/layer.js") %}

## Release history

### v2.0.0

**Breaking changes**

- en-route was completely refactored from the ground-up. 

### v1.0.0

**Breaking changes**

- en-route no longer supports error middleware (middleware with three arguments). This was done to simplify debugging, eliminate code debt that makes en-route harder to maintain and improve, to make en-route and middleware run faster, and to make certain that errors are always passed to the final done function.
