## Release history

### v2.0.0

**Breaking changes**

- en-route was completely refactored from the ground-up. 

### v1.0.0

**Breaking changes**

- en-route no longer supports error middleware (middleware with three arguments). This was done to simplify debugging, eliminate code debt that makes en-route harder to maintain and improve, to make en-route and middleware run faster, and to make certain that errors are always passed to the final done function.
